msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. "
"Child marriage often compromises a girl’s development by resulting in early "
"pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her "
"opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at "
"increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls "
"reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with "
"womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. \n"
"\n"
"The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender "
"inequality. \n"
"\n"
"The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international "
"conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in "
"the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to "
"other rights – such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to "
"protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from "
"harmful traditional practices."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"Both formal (i.e., marriages) and informal unions are covered under this "
"indicator. Informal unions are generally defined as those in which a couple "
"lives together for some time, intends to have a lasting relationship, but "
"for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., "
"cohabitation)."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries "
"have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. "
"The modules used to collect information on marital status among women and "
"men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully "
"harmonized."

"# Methodology\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"Number of women aged 20-24 who were first married or in union before age 15 "
"(or before age 18) divided by the total number of women aged 20-24 in the "
"population multiplied by 100"

"## Treatment of missing values\n"
"* At country level: When data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF "
"does not publish any country-level estimate. \n"

"countries within the region with missing values for the purposes of "
"calculating regional aggregates only but are not published as country-level "
"estimates."

"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data "
"at the national level\n"
"Countries gather data on child marriage through household surveys such as "
"UNICEF-supported MICS or Demographic and Health Surveys. In some countries, "
"such data are also collected through other national household surveys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "QUALITY_ASSURE"
msgid ""
"## Quality assurance\n"
"UNICEF maintains the global database on child marriage that is used for SDG "
"and other official reporting. Before the inclusion of any data point in the "
"database, it is reviewed by technical focal points at UNICEF headquarters "
"to check for consistency and overall data quality. This review is based on "
"a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and "
"reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria include "
"the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values "
"must be representative at the national population level; data are collected "
"using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on "
"a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator "
"definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data "
"are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously "
"published/reported estimates for the indicator. \n"
"\n"
"As of 2018, UNICEF undertakes an annual consultation with government "
"authorities on 10 of the child-related SDG indicators in its role of sole "
"or joint custodian, and in line with its global monitoring mandate and "
"normative commitments to advancing the 2030 Agenda for children. This "
"includes indicator 5.3.1. More details on the process for the country "
"consultation are outlined below."

msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"
msgid ""
"# Data sources\n"
"## Description\n"
"Household surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been "
"collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since "
"around the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also collected "
"through national censuses or other national household surveys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"## Collection process\n"
"UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing "
"data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global "
"databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF "
"used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and "
"international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was "
"known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).\n"
" \n"
" As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with "
"national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is "
"custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data "
"flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis "
"on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and "
"statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from "
"National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies "
"responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, "
"including the data sources used, and the application of internationally "
"agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that "
"source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether "
"or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. More "
"details on the consultation process can be found in the "
"[guidance note](https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/guidance/)."
