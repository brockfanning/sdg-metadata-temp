"\n"
"National poverty estimates is a different concept from international "
"poverty estimates. National poverty rate is defined at country-specific "
"poverty lines in local currencies, which are different in real terms across "
"countries and different from the $1.90-a-day international poverty line. "
"Thus, national poverty rates cannot be compared across countries or with "
"the $1.90-a-day poverty rate."

"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty "
"according to national definitions, one naturally focuses on a poverty line "
"that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines across "
"countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong "
"economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher "
"standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost of "
"living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some "
"countries may have separate urban and rural poverty lines to represent "
"different purchasing powers."

"# Data Availability\n"
"\n"
"## Description\n"
"\n"
"Data availability depends on the availability of household surveys and "
"analysis of survey data. Data for total, rural and urban poverty are "
"currently available for 132, 101 and 103 countries, respectively."

"# Methodology\n"
"\n"
"## Computation Method\n"
"\n"
"The formula for calculating the proportion of the total, urban and rural "
"population living below the national poverty line, or headcount index, is "
"as follows:\n"
"\n"
"\\\\[ P_0 = {1 \\over N} \\underset{>=1}{\\underset{i}{\\overset{N}{\\Sigma}}}"
" I ( y_i < z ) = {N_p \\over N} \\\\]\n"
"\n"
"Where \\\\(I(.)\\\\) is an indicator function that takes on a value of 1 if the "
"bracketed expression is true, and 0 otherwise. If individual consumption or "
"income \\\\(y_i\\\\) is less than the national poverty line \\\\(z\\\\) (for "
"example, in absolute terms the line could be the price of a consumption "
"bundle or in relative terms a percentage of the income distribution), then "
"\\\\(I(.)\\\\) is equal to 1 and the individual is counted as poor. \\\\(N_p\\\\) "
"is the total, urban or rural number of poor. \\\\(N\\\\) is the total, urban or "
"rural population.\n"
"\n"
"Consumption or income data are gathered from nationally representative "
"household surveys, which contain detailed responses to questions regarding "
"spending habits and sources of income. Consumption, including consumption "
"from own production, or income is calculated for the entire household. In "
"some cases, an “effective” household size is calculated from the actual "
"household size to reflect assumed efficiencies in consumption; adjustments "
"may also be made to reflect the number of children in a household. The "
"number of people in those households is aggregated to estimate the number "
"of poor persons.\n"
"\n"
"National poverty rates use a country specific poverty line, reflecting the "
"country’s economic and social circumstances. In some case, the national "
"poverty line is adjusted for different areas (such as urban and rural) "
"within the country, to account for differences in prices or the "
"availability of goods and services. Typically the urban poverty line is set "
"higher than the rural poverty line; reflecting the relatively higher costs "
"of living in urban areas."

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development "
"agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of "
"poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social "
"circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of "
"poverty rates."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"National poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats "
"and limitations inherent to survey data applying to the construction of "
"indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.\n"
"\n"
"To be useful for poverty estimates, surveys must be nationally "
"representative. They must also include enough information to compute a "
"comprehensive estimate of total household consumption or income (including "
"consumption or income from own production) and to construct a correctly "
"weighted distribution of consumption or income per person.\n"
"\n"
"Consumption is the preferred welfare indicator for a number of reasons. "
"[^1] Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately. For example, "
"the poor who work in the informal sector may not receive or report monetary "
"wages; self-employed workers often experience irregular income flows; and "
"many people in rural areas depend on idiosyncratic, agricultural incomes. "
"Moreover, consumption accords better with the idea of the standard of "
"living than income, which can vary over time even if the actual standard of "
"living does not. Thus, whenever possible, consumption-based welfare "
"indicators are used to estimate the poverty measures reported here. But "
"consumption data are not always available. For instance in Latin America "
"and the Caribbean, the vast majority of countries collect primarily income "
"data. In those cases there is little choice but to use income data.\n"
"\n"
"Consumption is measured by using household survey questions on food and "
"nonfood expenditures as well as food consumed from the household’s own "
"production, which is particularly important in the poorest developing "
"countries. This information is collected either through recall questions "
"using lists of consumption items or through diaries in which respondents "
"record all expenditures daily. But these methods do not always provide "
"equivalent information, and depending on the approach used, consumption can "
"be underestimated or overestimated. Different surveys use different recall "
"or reference periods. Depending on the true flow of expenditures, the rate "
"of spending reported is sensitive to the length of reporting period. The "
"longer the reference period, the more likely respondents will fail to "
"recall certain expenses—especially food items—thus resulting in "
"underestimation of true expenditure.\n"
"\n"
"Best-practice surveys administer detailed lists of specific consumption "
"items. These individual items collected through the questionnaires are "
"aggregated afterwards. But many surveys use questionnaires in which "
"respondents are asked to report expenditures for broad categories of goods. "
"In other words, specific consumption items are implicitly aggregated by "
"virtue of the questionnaire design. This shortens the interview, reducing "
"the cost of the survey. A shorter questionnaire is also thought to reduce "
"the likelihood of fatigue for both respondents and interviewers, which can "
"lead to reporting errors. However, there is also evidence that less "
"detailed coverage of specific items in the questionnaire can lead to "
"underestimation of actual household consumption. The reuse of "
"questionnaires may cause new consumption goods to be omitted, leading to "
"further underreporting.\n"
"\n"
"Invariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because "
"they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home. This is often referred "
"to as “unit nonresponse” and is distinct from “item nonresponse,” which "
"occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to "
"answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to consumption or "
"income. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no "
"concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still "
"be representative of the population. However, households with different "
"incomes are not equally likely to respond. Relatively rich households may "
"be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their "
"time or because of concerns about intrusion in their affairs. It is "
"conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are "
"homeless and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some "
"may be physically or socially isolated and thus less easily interviewed. If "
"nonresponse systematically increases with income, surveys will tend to "
"overestimate poverty. But if compliance tends to be lower for both the very "
"poor and the very rich, there will be potentially offsetting effects on the "
"measured incidence of poverty.\n"
"\n"
"Even if survey data were entirely accurate and comprehensive, the measure "
"of poverty obtained could still fail to capture important aspects of "
"individual welfare. For example, using household consumption measures "
"ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or "
"income-based poverty measures are informative but should not be interpreted "
"as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of people’s lives. The "
"national poverty rate, a “headcount” measure, is one of the most commonly "
"calculated measures of poverty. Yet it has the drawback that it does not "
"capture income inequality among the poor or the depth of poverty. For "
"instance, it fails to account for the fact that some people may be living "
"just below the poverty line, while others experience far greater "
"shortfalls. Policymakers seeking to make the largest possible impact on the "
"headcount measure might be tempted to direct their poverty alleviation "
"resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore least poor).\n"
"\n"
"Issues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries when "
"urban and rural poverty lines represent different purchasing powers. For "
"example, the cost of living is typically higher in urban than in rural "
"areas. One reason is that food staples tend to be more expensive in urban "
"areas. So the urban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural "
"poverty line. But it is not always clear that the difference between urban "
"and rural poverty lines found in practice reflects only differences in the "
"cost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has "
"a higher real value—meaning that it allows the purchase of more commodities "
"for consumption—than does the rural poverty line. Sometimes the difference "
"has been so large as to imply that the incidence of poverty is greater in "
"urban than in rural areas, even though the reverse is found when "
"adjustments are made only for differences in the cost of living. As with "
"international comparisons, when the real value of the poverty line varies "
"it is not clear how meaningful such urban-rural comparisons are.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully "
"reflect the other dimensions of poverty such as inequality, vulnerability, "
"and lack of voice and power of the poor."

"## Description\n"
"\n"
"National poverty estimates are typically produced and owned by country "
"governments (e.g., National Statistic Office), and sometimes with technical "
"assistance from the World Bank and UNDP. Upon release of the national "
"poverty estimates by the government, the Global Poverty Working Group of "
"the World Bank assesses the methodology used by the government, validates "
"the estimates with raw data whenever possible, and consults the country "
"economists for publishing. Accepted estimates, along with metadata, will be "
"published in the WDI database as well as the Poverty and Equity Database of "
"the World Bank. \n"
"\n"
"Another source is World Bank’s Poverty Assessments. The World Bank "
"periodically prepares poverty assessments of countries in which it has an "
"active program, in close collaboration with national institutions, other "
"development agencies, and civil society groups, including poor people’s "
"organizations. Poverty assessments report the extent and causes of poverty "
"and propose strategies to reduce it. The poverty assessments are the best "
"available source of information on poverty estimates using national poverty "
"lines. They often include separate assessments of urban and rural poverty."
