"\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"\n"
"Public and publicly guaranteed external debt data are compiled by the World "
"Bank based on the World Bank Debtor Reporting System Manual, dated January "
"2000 which sets out the reporting procedures to be used by countries. The "
"data are provided by the countries on a loan by loan basis. \n"
"\n"
"“Exports of goods and services” data are sourced from IMF’s Balance of "
"Payments Statistics database and then gap-filled with World Bank staff "
"estimates in accordance with the sixth edition of the *Balance of Payments "
"and International Investment Position Manual* (*BPM6*) \n"

"# Data providers\n"
"\n"
"The agency in charge of producing the debt statistics at the national level "
"is the World Bank with the data sourced by government agencies on a loan by "
"loan basis. The national data provider of “Exports of Goods, and Services” "
"is the institution in charge of the collection and compilation of the "
"Balance of Payments statistics. This responsibility varies and is country "
"specific (i.e. Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for “Exports of "
"Goods and Services” data are used for gap filling purposes. “Exports of "
"Goods and Services” data are not reported directly to the World Bank from "
"the national data provider. They are reported to the International Monetary "
"Fund (IMF), which is the institution in charge of overseeing balance of "
"payment stability as part of its institutional mandate."

"\n"
"In accordance with the World Bank’s Operational Policy 14.10 (which "
"includes IBRD and IDA General Conditions) external debt reporting is "
"required to fulfil the World Bank’s needs for reliable and timely external "
"debt information to (a) assess a borrowing country's foreign debt "
"situation, creditworthiness, and economic management; and (b) conduct its "
"country economic work and assess regional and global indebtedness and debt "
"servicing problems. \n"
"\n"
"External borrowing of reporting countries is performed through the Debtor "
"Reporting System (DRS), which was established in 1951 and captures detailed "
"information at loan level by using standardized set of forms."
