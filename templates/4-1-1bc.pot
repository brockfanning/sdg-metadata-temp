"Percentage of children and young people in Grade 2 or 3 of primary "
"education, at the end of primary education and the end of lower secondary "
"education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (a) reading and "
"(b) mathematics. The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"The indicator is a direct measure of the learning outcomes achieved in the "
"two subject areas at the end of the relevant stages of education. The three "
"measurement points will have their own established minimum standard. There "
"is only one threshold that divides students into above and below minimum:  \n"
"\n"
"1. Below minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who do not "
"achieve a minimum standard as set up by countries according to the "
"globally-defined minimum competencies.\n"
"\n"
"2. Above minimum is the proportion or percentage of students who have "
"achieved the minimum standards. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels "
"set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels "
"will have to be mapped to the globally-defined minimum performance levels. "
"Once the performance levels are mapped, the global education community will "
"be able to identify for each country the proportion or percentage of "
"children who achieved minimum standards.\n"
"{:type='a'}\n"

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"Minimum proficiency level is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain "
"(mathematics or reading) measured through learning assessments. For "
"example, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reading "
"test has six proficiency levels, of which Level 2 is described as the "
"minimum proficiency level. In Trends in International Mathematics and "
"Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study "
"(PIRLS), there are four proficiency levels: Low, Intermediate, High and "
"Advanced. Students reaching the Intermediate benchmark are able to apply "
"basic knowledge in a variety of situations, similar to the idea of minimum "
"proficiency. Currently, there are no common standards validated by the "
"international community or countries. The indicator shows data published by "
"each of the agencies and organizations specialised in cross-national "
"learning assessments."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"While data from many national assessments are available now, every country "
"sets its own standards so the performance levels might not be comparable. "
"One option is to link existing regional assessments based on a common "
"framework. Furthermore, assessments are typically administered within "
"school systems, the current indicators cover only those in school and the "
"proportion of in-school target populations might vary from country to "
"country due to varied out-of-school children populations. Assessing "
"competencies of children and young people who are out of school would "
"require household-based surveys. Assessing children in households is under "
"consideration but may be very costly and difficult to administer and "
"unlikely to be available on the scale needed within the next 3-5 years. "
"Finally, the calculation of this indicator requires specific information on "
"the ages of children participating in assessments to create "
"globally-comparable data. The ages of children reported by the head of the "
"household might not be consistent and reliable so the calculation of the "
"indicator may be even more challenging. Due to the complication in "
"assessing out-of-school children and the main focus on improving education "
"system, the UIS is taking a stepping stone approach. It will concentrate on "
"assessing children in school in the medium term, where much data are "
"available, then develop more coherent implementation plan to assess "
"out-of-school children in the longer term."

"# Methodology\n"
"\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"The indicator is calculated as the percentage of children and/or young "
"people at the relevant stage of education achieving or exceeding a "
"pre-defined proficiency level in a given subject. \n"
"\n"
"Performance above the minimum level, \\\\(PL_{tn,s}\\\\) above minimum = \\\\(p\\\\)\n"
"\n"
"where \\\\(p\\\\) is the percentage of students in a learning assessment at stage of "
"education \\\\(n\\\\), in subject \\\\(s\\\\) in any year (\\\\(t-i\\\\)) where \\\\(0 ? i ? 5\\\\), who has "
"achieved the level of proficiency that is greater than a pre-defined "
"minimum standard, \\\\(Smin\\\\). The minimum standard is defined by the global "
"education community taking into consideration regional differences."
