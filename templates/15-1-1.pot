"Forest area as a proportion of total land area"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including "
"the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and services "
"such as habitat for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection "
"and soil and water conservation. \n"
"\n"
"The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a "
"country. The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a "
"key element for forest policy and planning within the context of "
"sustainable development.\n"
"\n"
"Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may "
"help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural "
"sector.\n"
"\n"
"Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy "
"for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or "
"restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are "
"sustainably managed.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium "
"Development Goals (MDG) (indicator 7.1 “Proportion of land covered by "
"forest”)."

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to "
"provide a definition of “Forest” and “Total Land Area”. \n"
"\n"
"According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as: “land spanning more "
"than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of "
"more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It "
"does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban "
"land use”. More specifically:\n"
"* Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of "
"other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum "
"height of 5 meters.\n"
"* It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which "
"are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height "
"of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked "
"due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural "
"disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local "
"conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is "
"used.\n"
"* It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest "
"in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those "
"of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual "
"interest.\n"
"* It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area "
"of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.\n"
"* It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of "
"trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 "
"percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.\n"
"* It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this "
"area is classified as land area or not.\n"
"* It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.\n"
"* It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height "
"and canopy cover criteria are met.\n"
"* It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit "
"tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry "
"systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry "
"systems such as the “Taungya” system where crops are grown only during the "
"first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.\n"
"\n"
"Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area "
"covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes. \n"
"\n"
"The indicator is expressed as percent."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many "
"countries. Access to remote sensing imagery has improved in recent years, "
"but remote sensing techniques have limitations. In particular there are "
"limitations to assess land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land "
"cover), and some slow changes such as forest regrowth cannot easily be "
"observed with remote sensing techniques and require long time periods in "
"order to detect. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density "
"(e.g. 10-30%) are difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques."

"## Sources of discrepancies\n"

"reporting format ensures that countries provide the full reference for "
"original data sources as well as national definitions and terminology. "
"Separate sections in the reporting format (country reports) deal with the "
"analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for "
"estimates and projections to the common reporting years); calibration of "
"data to the official land area as held by FAO; and reclassification of data "

"\n"
"FAO has been collecting and analysing data on forest area since 1946. This "
"is done at intervals of 5-10 years as part of the Global Forest Resources "
"Assessment (FRA). FRA 2015 contains information for 234 countries and "
"territories on more than 100 variables related to the extent of forests, "
"their conditions, uses and values for three points in time: 1990, 2000, "
"2005, 2010 and 2015.\n"

"\n"
"Officially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the "
"country reports for the assessment. Some prepare more than one report as "
