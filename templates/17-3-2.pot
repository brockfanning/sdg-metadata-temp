"<p>Personal remittances received as proportion of GDP is the inflow of "

"(GDP). </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Personal remittances comprise of personal transfers and compensation of "
"employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or "
"in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident "
"households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between "
"resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to "
"the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are "
"employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents "
"employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in "
"the sixth edition of the IMF&apos;s <em>Balance of Payments Manual</em>: "
"personal transfers and compensation of employees.</p>\n"
