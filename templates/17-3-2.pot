"\n"
"Personal remittances comprise of personal transfers and compensation of "
"employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or "
"in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident "
"households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between "
"resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to "
"the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are "
"employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents "
"employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in "
"the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal "
"transfers and compensation of employees.\n"
"\n"
"The concepts used are in line with the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance "
"of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)."

"\n"
"Personal remittances are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition "
"of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and "
"compensation of employees. World Bank staff estimates on the volume of "
"personal remittances data are used for gap-filling purposes. GDP data, "

"are then used to express the indicator as a percentage of GDP."

"# Data providers\n"
"\n"
"The national data provider of personal remittances is the institution in "
"charge of the collection and compilation of the Balance of Payments "
"statistics. This responsibility varies and is country specific (i.e. "
"Central Bank). World Bank staff estimates for personal remittances data are "
"used for gap-filling purposes. Personal remittances data are not reported "
"directly to the World Bank from the national data provider. They are "
"reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is the institution "
"in charge of overseeing balance of payment stability as part of its "
"institutional mandate. \n"
"\n"
"GDP data are sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators "
"(WDI) database and are compiled in accordance to the *System of National "
"Accounts, 2008* (*2008 SNA*) methodology. GDP data collection is conducted "
"through the Unified Survey process, the World Bank’s principal mechanism "
"for gathering quantitative macroeconomic information on its member "
"countries."
