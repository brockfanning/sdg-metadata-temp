"## Definition\n"
"Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow "
"accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of "
"materials in a national economy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"DMC reports the amount of materials that are used in a national economy. "
"DMC is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC also presents the "
"amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy, which is "
"either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure "
"or used to fuel the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the "
"physical dimension of economic processes and interactions. It can also be "
"interpreted as long-term waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC describes the "
"average level of material use in an economy – an environmental pressure "
"indicator – and is also referred to as metabolic profile."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in "
"combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and "
"consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, "
"MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service "
"final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it "
"has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because "
"it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to "
"other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"DMC cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors which limits its potential "
"to become a satellite account to the System of National Accounts (SNA)."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"# Methodology\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic "
"extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials "
"measured in metric tonnes. DMC measure the amount of materials that are "
"used in economic processes. It does not include materials that are "
"mobilized the process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic "
"process. DMC is based on official economic statistics and it requires some "
"modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements of "
"the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the "
"EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA "
"accounting is also part of the central framework of the System  of "
"integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA)."

msgctxt "DISAGGREGATION"
msgid ""
"## Disaggregation\n"
"The DMC indicator can be disaggregated into imports, domestic extraction "
"and exports by a large number of material follow categories. At the highest "
"level of aggregation biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic "
"minerals are distinguished. DMC is usually reported for 11 material "
"categories, DE for 44 material categories."

msgctxt "IMPUTATION"
msgid ""
"## Treatment of missing values\n"
"* At a country level: \n"
"A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in "
"the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make up "
"this aggregated total. Thus “0.0” can represent either NA, or a genuine "
"0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. "
"This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further aggregations; "
"however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing values as "
"‘0.0’, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation. \n"
"* At regional and global levels: \n"
"Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global "
"aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a "
"particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted "
"averages of the available data."
