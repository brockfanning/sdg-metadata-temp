"## Definition\n"
"Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of *GFSM 2014* "
"an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal "
"indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General "
"government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are "
"taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code "
"13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and "
"transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government "
"units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable "
"by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are "
"actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make "
"provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers "
"receivable by government units from other resident or nonresident "
"government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the "
"definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all "
"revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other "
"revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; "
"(iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere "
"classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance "
"and standardized guarantee schemes.\n"
"\n"
"## Concepts\n"
"The transactions and the associated classifications are detailed "
"in Chapter 5 of *GFSM 2014* and are structured to demonstrate how general "
"government (and public sector) units raise revenue. Only those taxes and "
"social insurance contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and "
"declarations, customs declarations, and similar documents are considered to "
"create revenue for government units. Thus, the difference between "
"assessments and expected collections represents a claim that has no real "
"value and should not be recorded as revenue (see *GFSM 2014* paragraph 5.20). "
"The analytic framework of *GFSM 2014* (like that of the *GFSM 2001*) builds on "
"the *GFSM 1986* framework, and extends it by incorporating additional "
"elements that are useful in assessing fiscal policy. An important example "
"is the treatment of nonfinancial assets, where the sale of such assets is "
"no longer included in revenue. The disposal of a nonfinancial asset by sale "
"or barter is not revenue because it has no effect on net worth. Rather, it "
"changes the composition of the balance sheet by exchanging one asset (the "
"nonfinancial asset) for another (the proceeds of the sale). Similarly, "
"amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan disbursements are not "
"revenue. In general, transactions that increase net worth result from "
"current operations. Capital transfers are an exception. In *GFSM 2014*, "
"capital transfers receivable are classified as revenue because they "
"increase the recipient’s net worth and they are often indistinguishable "
"from current transfers in their effect on government operations. In "
"recording cash-based accounting revenue transactions, data representing the "
"tax payments received by government, net of refunds paid out during the "
"period covered should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after "
"the original assessment, taxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after "
"subsequent assessments, and taxes paid or refunds deducted after any "
"subsequent reopening of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be "
"presented on a gross basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on "
"a net basis as the gross amount minus tax refunds. Revenue categories are "
"presented gross of expense categories for the same or related category. In "
"particular, interest revenue is presented gross rather than as net interest "
"expense or net interest revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social "
"contributions, grant revenue and expense, and rent revenue and expense are "
"presented gross. Also, sales of goods and services are presented gross of "
"the expenses incurred in their production. In cases of erroneous or "
"unauthorized transactions, revenue categories are presented net of refunds "
"of the relevant revenue, and expense categories are presented net of "
"inflows from the recovery of the expense. For example, refunds of income "
"taxes may be paid when the amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid in "
"advance of the final determination exceeds the actual tax due. Such refunds "
"are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason, tax revenue is "
"presented net of non-payable tax credits (see *GFSM 2014* paragraphs "
"5.29–5.32)."

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale and interpretation\n"
"Fiscal policy is the use of the level and composition of the general "
"government and public sectors’ spending and revenue—and the related "
"accumulation of government assets and liabilities—to achieve such goals as "
"the stabilization of the economy, the reallocation of resources, and the "
"redistribution of income. In addition to revenue mobilization, government "
"units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific period "
"by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory "
"transfers—for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and "
"services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 *Total government "
"revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source* supports understanding countries’ "
"domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax sources. The "
"indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset "
"that highlights the relationship between the four main types of revenue as "
"well as the relative \"tax burden\" (revenue in the form of taxes) and "
"“fiscal burden” (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions)."

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"# Methodology\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"Indicator 17.1.1 will be derived using series that are "
"basic to the GFS reporting framework. GFS revenue series maintained by the "
"IMF Statistics Department are collected in Table 1 of the standard annual "
"data questionnaire. Each revenue transaction is classified according to "
"whether it is a tax or another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are "
"summations of individual entries and elements in this particular class of "
"flows and allow for these data to be arranged in a manageable and "
"analytically useful way. For example, tax revenue is the sum of all flows "
"that are classified as taxes. Conceptually, the value for each main revenue "
"aggregate is the sum of the values for all items in the relevant category. "
"The annual GFS series for monitoring Indicator 17.1.1 will be derived from "
"the data reported by the national authorities (in national currency) "
"expressed as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), where GDP is "
"derived from the IMF *World Economic Outlook* database (no adjustments and/or "
"weighting techniques will be applied). Mixed sources are not being used nor "
"will the calculation change over time (i.e., there are no discontinuities "
"in the underlying series as these are key aggregates/ components in all "
"country reported GFS series). The presentation will closely align with that "
"currently contained in World Table 4 from the hard-copy *GFS Yearbook*: \n"

"## Treatment of missing values\n"
"The IMF plans to rely exclusively on officially reported data provided by "
"the national authorities using the standard GFS questionnaire based on *GFSM "
"2014* methodology. No country data estimates for missing values will be "
"calculated by the IMF Statistics Department. Where country data are not "
"available due to a lack of reporting to the IMF Statistics Department, we "
"plan to engage in outreach to the national authorities, in consultation "
"with the respective IMF Area Departments and Offices of the Executive "
"Director, as needed, to ensure that the key GFS series are reported."

"## Sources and data collection\n"
"The actual and recommended sources of data for deriving this indicator are "
"the fiscal statistics reported to the IMF’s Statistics Department. These "
"come from various national agencies (Ministries of Finance, Central Banks, "
"National Statistics Offices, etc.) and are compiled according to a "
"standardized method for data collection: the annual GFS Questionnaire. In "
"the 2017 annual reporting cycle, 127 countries reported the relevant series "
"for monitoring indicator 17.1.1. For current non-reporting countries that "
"have demonstrated the capacity to compile and report the relevant GFS "
"revenue series, the IMF Statistics Department is engaged in outreach to the "
"national authorities, in consultation with the respective IMF Area "
"Departments and Offices of the Executive Director, as needed. Capacity "
"Development activities will seek to address data deficiencies, including "
"through regional workshops. The steps outlined above should allow, over "
"time, for covering virtually the entire IMF membership."

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal "
"policies. Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the "
"consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and "
"many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general "
"government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the "
"availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may "
"have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional "
"governments; and many local governments. Countries may also have social "
"security funds. The *GFSM 2014* recommends that statistics should be compiled "
"for all such general government units. This reporting structure is "
"illustrated below:\n"

"Some countries report data for the consolidated general government with one "
"or more sub-sectors not separately reported. Similarly, there are some "
"countries that report “consolidated central government” without necessarily "
"providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. "
"Conceptually, a World Aggregate could be calculated by computing a weighted "
"average from available sources using GDP expressed in United States "
"dollars. However, at this time the IMF Statistics Department recommends no "
"regional and global aggregates be established. While we see no issues in "
"terms of the feasibility and suitability of 17.1.1 for cross-country "
"comparisons, we question the relevance of one single global indicator that "
"combines data for advanced economies with those of emerging market and "
"low-income countries. To address this, the country data are presented, "
"where reported, for the budgetary central government, the consolidated "
"central government (with and without social security funds), and for "
"consolidated general government. \n"
"\n"
"For many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical "
"capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate "
"level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central "
"government, as described in *GFSM 2014* (paragraph 2.81), is an institutional "
"unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of "
"size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other "
"units and entities. This component of general government is usually covered "
"by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue "
"(and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of "
"finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the "
"legislature."

"# Data Availability\n"
"## Current data availability / indicator tier\n"
"Classification of the indicator into one of the three tiers: We recommend "
"that 17.1.1 (like 17.1.2) remain classified as Tier 1: The indicator is "
"conceptually clear and internationally agreed standards for compiling "
"components and aggregates are available. The underlying data are regularly "
"produced by countries, and there is current data available. From the "
"IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification description at "
"<https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/>, a key criteria "
"is that “data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent "
"of countries”. The IMF GFS database, with 120+ regular annual reporting "
"countries using the same reporting format meets this key criteria. Apart "
"from conflict countries, all IMF member countries produce revenue (and "
"expenditure) data for surveillance purposes. In the 2017 round of "
"soliciting annual GFS series from countries, we have specifically "
"encouraged those countries that were non-reporters over the past few years "
"to (at a minimum) provide the key revenue and expenditure series needed to "
"monitor 17.1."
