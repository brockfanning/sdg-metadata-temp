"<p>Concepts and definitions</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of "
"available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater "
"withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, "
"after taking into account environmental water requirements. Main sectors, "
"as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; "
"manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also "
"known as water withdrawal intensity.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the "
"country&#x2019;s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water "
"stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors "
"is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little "
"potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential "
"competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a "
"situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a "
"substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with "
"potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and "
"potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. </p>\n"
"<p>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of "
"internal and external renewable water resources. The terms &#x201C;water "
"resources&#x201D; and &#x201C;water withdrawal&#x201D; are understood here "
"as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. </p>\n"
"<p>Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average "
"annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country "
"generated from endogenous precipitation. </p>\n"
"<p>.</p>\n"
"<p>External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering "
"the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to "
"upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. </p>\n"
"<p>Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted "
"from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and "
"municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following "
"three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water "
"withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary "
"freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously "
"withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater, such as discharged "
"wastewater and agricultural drainage water) and fossil groundwater. It does "
"not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, "
"direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in "
"general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector "
"minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water "
"and use of desalinated water. </p>\n"
"<p>Environmental water requirements (Env.) are the quantities of water "
"required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. Water quality and "
"also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation "
"which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and "
"the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not "
"important and should not be taken care of. Methods of computation of Env. "
"are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive "
"assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water "
"volumes can be expressed in the same units as the TWW, and then as "
"percentages of the available water resources.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water "
"resources are being exploited to meet the country&apos;s water demand. It "
"measures a country&apos;s pressure on its water resources and therefore the "
"challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in "
"regard to &#x201C;withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water "
"scarcity&#x201D;, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and "
"signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. "
"It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between "
"different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. "
"Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, "
"has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural "
"resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the "
"indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for "
"economic development and sustainability.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Water withdrawal as a percentage of water resources is a good indicator "
"of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural "
"resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to "
"sustainable water management. </p>\n"
"<p>Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water "
"management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural "
"changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate "
"infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and "
"sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and "
"economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic "
"environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in "
"agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is "
"also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator and there "
"is no universal consensus on such threshold. </p>\n"
"<p>Trends in water withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. "
"Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect "
"significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show "
"meaningful variations from one year to the other. </p>\n"
"<p>Estimation of water withdrawal by sector is the main limitation to the "
"computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water use data "
"on a regular basis by sector. </p>\n"
"<p>Renewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater "
"resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the "
"capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, "
"which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available "
"with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable "
"water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable "
"water resources.</p>\n"
"<p>There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming "
"freshwater flows originating outside of a country&apos;s borders. Nor is "
"there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the "
"water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system "
"after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of "
"water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and "
"therefore overestimate the level of water stress. </p>\n"
"<p>Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress "
"indicator include: </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; </li>\n"
"  <li>potentially large variation of sub-national data; </li>\n"
"  <li>lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;</li>\n"
"  <li>lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; </li>\n"
"  <li>lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; "
"and</li>\n"
"  <li>the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal "
"includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to "
"the system), non-renewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual "
"groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment "
"(over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the "
"water set aside for environmental water requirements. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the index "
"at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different "
"use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a "
"country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.</p>"

"<p>Methodology</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Computation method:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater "
"withdrawn (TWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable "
"freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental water requirements "
"(Env.), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in "
"km<sup>3</sup>/year (10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year).</p>\n"
"<p>Stress (%) = TWW / (TRWR - Env.) * 100</p>\n"
"<p>It is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main "
"categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the "
"indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and "
"national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds "
"could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account "
"environmental water requirements.</p>"

"<h2>Quality assurance:</h2>\n"
"<p>Every data in AQUASTAT goes through a thorough validation process:</p>\n"
"<p>Before uploading, data is compared to other variables to ensure it is "
"logically correct (in other words: 1+2=3) and whether the reference used is "
"not leading back to AQUASTAT itself. In other words, AQUASTAT frequently "
"finds data for 2014, which is really AQUASTAT data for 2000 with the year "
"changed (most probably when the data was harvested).</p>\n"
"<p>During uploading into the Main Database, another validation process "
"takes place, using a set of about 300 validation rules. Of these, about 100 "
"rules are obligatory rules, which means that if the data-point doesn&apos;t "
"obey this rule, the validation process cannot go on. For example, the "
"cultivated area of a country cannot be larger than the total area of the "
"country. The other set of about 200 validation rules are warning signs for "
"the person doing the validation. For example, in general the area equipped "
"for irrigation using surface irrigation technology is at least half of the "
"total area equipped for irrigation. However, in some countries the "
"localized irrigation area or the sprinkler irrigation area might be larger "
"than the surface irrigation area. If this is the case, then a warning pops "
"up during validation for the analyst to check whether for this country it "
"is possible. Also during the validation process each new data-point is "
"compared to other data already available for this variable in other years "
"or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the "
"different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the "
"database. </p>\n"

"<p>Beyond the usual AQUASTAT validation described above, in the compilation "
"of the indicator countries will be encouraged and supported in setting up "
"their own quality control system, ensuring that all data used in the "
"computation are checked, and that consistency is kept over the years to "
"ensure comparability and robust identification of trends.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator requires data from different sectors of expertise. "
"Internationally, they are available of different datasets from various "
"institutions, such as FAO, UNSD and IWMI. Each of these institutions has "
"its own established mechanism to consult and validate the data with the "
"countries.</p>\n"
"<p>For the data deriving from FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, data are collected in "
"countries through surveys consisting of data collection and country "
"description by means of a detailed questionnaires were the source reference "
"and comments are associated with each value, through national resource "
"persons. Critical analysis of information and data processing is done by "
"FAO staff. Data are then organized in standard data tables, and feedback "
"and approval is sought from national institutions before publication and "
"dissemination.</p>\n"
"<p>However, for the SDG process a specific mechanism will be put in place, "
"consisting in the identification in each country, by the national "
"government, of a national focal point and a technical team, in charge of "
"the collection and computation of the indicator, in close consultation with "
"FAO. This system has been successfully tested during the initial phase of "
"the GEMI project, carried out by FAO and other seven UN agencies, "
"coordinated by UN-Water.</p>\n"
"<p>For those countries that could initially have difficulties in compiling "
"and computing the indicator, FAO will provide support and ultimately will "
"be able to produce the indicator starting from internationally available "
"data. However, no data will be made public without the prior approval by "
"the relevant national authorities.</p>"

"<p>To compute this indicator sectoral data are needed. The indicator can be "

"the country&#x2019;s water stress, and therefore the relative importance of "
"actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors "
"(agriculture, municipalities and industry). </p>\n"
"<p>At national level, water resources and withdrawal are estimated or "
"measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, "
"aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution "
"of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted "
"response in terms of water demand management.</p>"

"be done by adding up the internal renewable water resources (water "
