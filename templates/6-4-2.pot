"## Definition\n"
"The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of "
"available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater "
"withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, "
"after taking into account environmental water requirements. Main sectors, "
"as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; "
"manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also "
"known as water withdrawal intensity."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water "
"resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It "
"measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the "
"challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in "
"regard to “withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity”, "
"i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and "
"signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. "
"It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between "
"different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. "
"Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, "
"has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural "
"resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the "
"indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for "
"economic development and sustainability."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the "
"country’s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress "
"indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is "
"marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential "
"impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential "
"competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a "
"situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a "
"substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with "
"potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and "
"potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. \n"
"\n"
"Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of "
"internal and external renewable water resources. The terms “water "
"resources” and “water withdrawal” are understood here as freshwater "
"resources and freshwater withdrawal. \n"
"\n"
"Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average "
"annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country "
"generated from endogenous precipitation. \n"
"\n"
"External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the "
"country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to "
"upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. \n"
"\n"
"Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted "
"from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and "
"municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following "
"three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water "
"withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary "
"freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously "
"withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater, such as discharged "
"wastewater and agricultural drainage water) and fossil groundwater. It does "
"not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, "
"direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in "
"general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector "
"minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water "
"and use of desalinated water. \n"
"\n"
"Environmental water requirements (Env.) are the quantities of water "
"required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. Water quality and "
"also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation "
"which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and "
"the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not "
"important and should not be taken care of. Methods of computation of Env. "
"are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive "
"assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water "
"volumes can be expressed in the same units as the TWW, and then as "
"percentages of the available water resources."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"Water withdrawal as a percentage of water resources is a good indicator of "
"pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural "
"resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to "
"sustainable water management. \n"
"\n"
"Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water "
"management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural "
"changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate "
"infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and "
"sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and "
"economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic "
"environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in "
"agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is "
"also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator and there "
"is no universal consensus on such threshold. \n"
"\n"
"Trends in water withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. "
"Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect "
"significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show "
"meaningful variations from one year to the other. \n"
"\n"
"Estimation of water withdrawal by sector is the main limitation to the "
"computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water use data "
"on a regular basis by sector. \n"
"\n"
"Renewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater "
"resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the "
"capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, "
"which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available "
"with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable "
"water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable "
"water resources.\n"
"\n"
"There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming "
"freshwater flows originating outside of a country's borders. Nor is there "
"any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water "
"withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after "
"use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water "
"withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and "
"therefore overestimate the level of water stress. \n"
"\n"
"Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress "
"indicator include: \n"
"* difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; \n"
"* potentially large variation of sub-national data; \n"
"* lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;\n"
"* lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; \n"
"* lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and\n"
"* the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal "
"includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to "
"the system), non-renewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual "
"groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment "
"(over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the "
"water set aside for environmental water requirements. \n"
"\n"
"Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the index at "
"the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use "
"sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a "
"country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"# Methodology\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (\\\\(TWW\\\\)) divided "
"by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (\\\\(TRWR\\\\)) "
"and the environmental water requirements (\\\\(Env.\\\\)), multiplied by 100. All "
"variables are expressed in km<sup>3</sup>/year (109 m<sup>3</sup>/year).\n"
"\n"
"\\\\[Stress (\\%) = TWW \\div (TRWR - Env.) \\times 100\\\\]\n"
"\n"
"It is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main "
"categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the "
"indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and "
"national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds "
"could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account "
"environmental water requirements."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DISAGGREGATION"
msgid ""
"## Disaggregation\n"
"To compute this indicator sectoral data are needed. The indicator can be "
"disaggregated to show the respective contribution of different sectors to "
"the country’s water stress, and therefore the relative importance of "
"actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors "
"(agriculture, municipalities and industry). \n"
"\n"
"At national level, water resources and withdrawal are estimated or measured "
"at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It "
"is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress "
"by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of "
"water demand management."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "IMPUTATION"
msgid ""
"## Treatment of missing values\n"
"* At country level: If scattered data are available, a methodology will be "
"developed with regards to inter- and extrapolation. \n"
"* At regional and global levels: For the MDGs, latest values were used to "
"obtain regional or global aggregates, even if not available for the same "
"year. It is expected that through the baseline that will be produced for "
"the SDG monitoring, data for more or less the same range of years become "
"available."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REG_AGG"
msgid ""
"## Regional aggregates\n"
"Regional and global estimates will be done by summing up the national "
"figures on renewable freshwater resources and total freshwater withdrawal, "
"considering only the internal renewable water resources of each country in "
"order to avoid double counting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "ADJUSTMENT"
msgid ""
"## Sources of discrepancies\n"
"Differences might occur due to the following, amongst others: For national "
"estimates incoming water is counted as being part of the country’s "
"available water resources, while global estimates can only be done by "
"adding up the internal renewable water resources (water generated within "
"the country) of all countries in order to avoid double counting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DOC_METHOD"
msgid ""
"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data "
"at the national level\n"
"This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the "
"country’s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress "
"indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is "
"marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential "
"impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential "
"competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a "
"situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a "
"substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with "
"potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and "
"potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.\n"
"The indicator is computed based on three components:\n"
"\n"
"* Total renewable freshwater resources (\\\\(TRWR\\\\))\n"
"* Total freshwater withdrawal (\\\\(TWW\\\\))\n"
"* Environmental flow requirements (\\\\(EFR\\\\))\n"
"\n"
"\\\\[Water\\:Stress (\\%) = {TWW \\over {TRWR-EFR.}} \\times 100\\\\]\n"

msgctxt "QUALITY_ASSURE"
msgid ""
"## Quality assurance\n"
"Every data in AQUASTAT goes through a thorough validation process:\n"
"Before uploading, data is compared to other variables to ensure it is "
"logically correct (in other words: 1+2=3) and whether the reference used is "
"not leading back to AQUASTAT itself. In other words, AQUASTAT frequently "
"finds data for 2014, which is really AQUASTAT data for 2000 with the year "
"changed (most probably when the data was harvested).\n"
"\n"
"During uploading into the Main Database, another validation process takes "
"place, using a set of about 300 validation rules. Of these, about 100 rules "
"are obligatory rules, which means that if the data-point doesn't obey this "
"rule, the validation process cannot go on. For example, the cultivated area "
"of a country cannot be larger than the total area of the country. The other "
"set of about 200 validation rules are warning signs for the person doing "
"the validation. For example, in general the area equipped for irrigation "
"using surface irrigation technology is at least half of the total area "
"equipped for irrigation. However, in some countries the localized "
"irrigation area or the sprinkler irrigation area might be larger than the "
"surface irrigation area. If this is the case, then a warning pops up during "
"validation for the analyst to check whether for this country it is "
"possible. Also during the validation process each new data-point is "
"compared to other data already available for this variable in other years "
"or in the same year. If it is impossible to harmonize or reconcile the "
"different data, then one or the other data-point has to be deleted from the "
"database. \n"
"<http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/WhyDBisEmpty_eng.pdf>\n"
"<http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/About_us/index3.stm>\n"
"\n"
"Beyond the usual AQUASTAT validation described above, in the compilation of "
"the indicator countries will be encouraged and supported in setting up "
"their own quality control system, ensuring that all data used in the "
"computation are checked, and that consistency is kept over the years to "
"ensure comparability and robust identification of trends.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator requires data from different sectors of expertise. "
"Internationally, they are available of different datasets from various "
"institutions, such as FAO, UNSD and IWMI. Each of these institutions has "
"its own established mechanism to consult and validate the data with the "
"countries.\n"
"For the data deriving from FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, data are collected in "
"countries through surveys consisting of data collection and country "
"description by means of a detailed questionnaires were the source reference "
"and comments are associated with each value, through national resource "
"persons. Critical analysis of information and data processing is done by "
"FAO staff. Data are then organized in standard data tables, and feedback "
"and approval is sought from national institutions before publication and "
"dissemination.\n"
"\n"
"However, for the SDG process a specific mechanism will be put in place, "
"consisting in the identification in each country, by the national "
"government, of a national focal point and a technical team, in charge of "
"the collection and computation of the indicator, in close consultation with "
"FAO. This system has been successfully tested during the initial phase of "
"the GEMI project, carried out by FAO and other seven UN agencies, "
"coordinated by UN-Water.\n"
"\n"
"For those countries that could initially have difficulties in compiling and "
"computing the indicator, FAO will provide support and ultimately will be "
"able to produce the indicator starting from internationally available data. "
"However, no data will be made public without the prior approval by the "
"relevant national authorities."
