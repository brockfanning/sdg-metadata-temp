"## Description\n"
"\n"
"Data for access to electricity are collected entirely from household "
"surveys (and occasionally censuses), tapping into a wide number of "
"different household survey types including: Demographic and Health Surveys "
"(DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator "
"Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally "
"developed and implemented surveys, including those by various government "
"agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).\n"
"\n"
"The World Bank is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a "
"metadatabase of statistics on electricity access harvested from the full "
"global body of household surveys. The World Bank Electrification Database "
"covers more than 180 countries for the period 1990-2012 and is updated "
"regularly.\n"

"Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a "

"    Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, "
"a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the "
"historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple "
"modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around "
"1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a "
"continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero "
"data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for "
"electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one "
"and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with "
"region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original "
"observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling "
"approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries "
"over these three time periods (Indicated as \"Estimate\").\n"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions "
"of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and "
"economic impacts, including facilitating development of household-based "
"income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good "
"starting point for tracking household energy access, it also presents a "
"number of limitations that will need to be addressed over time. In many "
"parts of the world, the presence of an electricity connection in the "
"household does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is "
"adequate in quality and reliability or affordable in cost and it would be "
"desirable to have fuller information about these critical attributes of the "
"service, which have been highlighted in SDG7.\n"
"\n"
"Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a "
"new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy "
"Access (World Bank) which is able to capture these broader dimensions of "
"service quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no "
"measure of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes "
"different levels of energy access, and also takes into account the "
"affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the "
"language of SDG7. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for "
"Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad "
"consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous "
"international agencies working in the field. A first Global Energy Access "
"Survey using this methodology has already been launched and is underway "
"expecting to yield results by early 2017. Discussions are also progressing "
"with the World Bank’s Household Survey Technical Working Group regarding "
"the mainstreaming of this methodology into the standardized household "
"questionnaire design that will be applied every three years in all low "
"income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the broader SDG "
"monitoring exercise.\n"
"\n"
"The adoption of this methodology will allow – over time – the more refined "
"measurement of energy access, making it possible to report more "
"disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity supply (grid or "
"off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), the "
"duration of service (daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of "
"service (in terms of number and length of unplanned service interruptions), "
"the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as "
"affordability and legality of service.\n"
"\n"
"Another advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only to "
"measuring energy access at the household level, but also its availability "
"to support enterprises and deliver critical community services, such as "
"health and education.\n"
"\n"
"Methodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy access "
"are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) (Chapter 2, "
"Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015) Report “Beyond Connections: "
"Energy Access Redefined” both of which are referenced below."
