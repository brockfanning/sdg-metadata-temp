"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow "
"accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of "
"materials in a national economy. </p>\n"
"<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in "
"combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and "
"consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, "
"MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service "
"final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it "
"has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because "
"it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to "
"other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. </p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>DMC reports the amount of materials that are used in a national economy. "
"DMC is a territorial (production side) indicator. DMC also presents the "
"amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy, which is "
"either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure "
"or used to fuel the economy as material throughput. DMC describes the "
"physical dimension of economic processes and interactions. It can also be "
"interpreted as long-term waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC describes the "
"average level of material use in an economy &#x2013; an environmental "
"pressure indicator &#x2013; and is also referred to as metabolic profile. "

"<p><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>DMC cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors which limits its "
"potential to become a satellite account to the System of National Accounts "
"(SNA). </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<p>Methodology</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Computation method:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic "
"extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials "
"measured in metric tonnes. DMC measure the amount of materials that are "
"used in economic processes. It does not include materials that are "
"mobilized the process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic "
"process. DMC is based on official economic statistics and it requires some "
"modelling to adapt the source data to the methodological requirements of "
"the MFA. The accounting standard and accounting methods are set out in the "
"EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA "
"accounting is also part of the central framework of the System of "
"integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA). </p>"

msgctxt "IMPUTATION"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Treatment of missing values:</strong></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>At country level</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, "
"in the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make "
"up this aggregated total. Thus &#x201C;0.0&#x201D; can represent either NA, "
"or a genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common "
"situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated into further "
"aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing "
"values as &#x2018;0.0&#x2019;, the aggregations may represent a lower value "
"than actual situation. </p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li>At regional and global levels</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global "
"aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a "
"particular country then the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted "
"averages of the available data. </p>"

"<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The DMC indicator can be disaggregated into imports, domestic extraction "

"level of aggregation biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic "
"minerals are distinguished. DMC is usually reported for 11 material "
"categories, DE for 44 material categories. </p>"
