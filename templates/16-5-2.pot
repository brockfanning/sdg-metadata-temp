"# Methodology\n"
"\n"
"## Computation Method\n"
"\n"
"The indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion "
"of firms which answered ‘yes’ to the survey question. For all Enterprise "
"Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling "
"weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, "
"incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata."

msgctxt "DATA_SOURCE"

"\n"
"The indicator is derived from Enterprise Surveys which are conducted by the "
"World Bank. The World Bank usually hires a private contractor (typically a "
"market research company) to conduct the survey fieldwork."

msgctxt "DISAGGREGATION"
msgid ""
"## Disaggregation\n"
"\n"
"The Enterprise Survey captures several descriptive characteristics of the "
"respondent firms including: gender of top manager, primary business "
"activity of the firm, subnational location of the firm, exporting status, "
"number of employees, degree of foreign ownership, and several other "
"characteristics. Hence the indicator can be disaggregated by the levels of "
"these individual characteristics."

"    Regional and global aggregates of the indicator are derived from "
"completed surveys. A single point estimate is created for each country and "
"a global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country’s point "
"estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example the "
"East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not "

"\n"
"When conducting our survey projects, the implementing fieldwork team must "

"can run our own quality control programs on the data.  After running these "
"programs, we provide the QC feedback to the implementing fieldwork team so "
"that survey data, which has been flagged, can be verified and continuously "
"improved.  This is how we continuously monitor the survey data while the "
"projects are in the field.\n"
"\n"
"The World Bank collects this survey data for the public good of "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are "
"solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when meeting with "
"tax officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries "
"and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of "
"corruption during this routine interaction. The key strength of the "
"Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to "
"the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding "
"corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question "
"but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality."

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in "
"the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this "
"question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an "
"opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s "
"reality.\n"
"\n"
"The limitations include that some countries’ data is almost 10 years old "
"(e.g. South Africa and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these "
"face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence "
"due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn’t been able to update some "
"of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation "
"is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and "
"hence most high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, "
"Canada, Western European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).\n"
"\n"
"Another limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some "
"countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on "
"corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of "
"confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been "
"subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual "
"incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the "
"calculated indicator value."

"## Definition\n"
"\n"
"Proportion of firms asked for a gift or informal payment when meeting with "
"tax officials.\n"
"\n"
"In every Enterprise Survey (<https://www.enterprisesurveys.org>), there is a standard "
"question which asks the survey respondent if they were inspected by or "
"required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent indicates ‘yes’, "
"then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was "
"expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during these "
"inspections/meetings. The response options include “yes”, “no”, “don’t "
"know”, and “refuse”.\n"
"\n"
"Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client "
"countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business "
"environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, "
"productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews "
"with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is "
"conducted approximately every 4-5 years."
