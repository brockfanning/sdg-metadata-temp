"<p>Concepts and definitions</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The proportion of the employed population below the international "
"poverty line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty "
"rate, is defined as the share of employed persons living in households with "
"per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty "
"line of US$1.90.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference "
"period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide "
"services for pay or profit.</p>\n"
"<p>Poverty Line: Threshold below which individuals in the reference "
"population are considered poor and above which they are considered "
"non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita monetary "
"requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic bundle "
"of goods and services. For the purpose of this indicator, an absolute "
"international poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.</p>\n"
"<p>Household in poverty: Households are defined as poor if their income or "
"consumption expenditure is below the poverty line taking into account the "
"number of household members and composition (e.g., number of adults and "
"children).</p>\n"
"<p>Working poor: Employed persons living in households that are classified "
"as poor, that is, that have income or consumption levels below the poverty "
"line used for measurement.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "SOURCE_TYPE"
msgid ""
"<p>Data Sources</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can "
"reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic "
"activity of the household&#x2019;s members. Examples include household "
"income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys "
"(LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect "
"information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing "
"the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to "
"be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same "
"observation period.</p>\n"
"<p>Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour "
"force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire "
"design. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for "
"collecting household income or consumption expenditure data, although an "
"attached income module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable "
"results, including ensuring an overlap in the observation period between "
"household income (or consumption expenditure) and employment status. </p>\n"
"<p>Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and "
"expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the "
"respondent households can be matched and consistency in the long "
"observation period between the surveys can be obtained.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of "
"poverty. </p>\n"
"<p>The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed "
"population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their "
"employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift</p>\n"
"<p>them and their families out of poverty and ensure decent living "
"conditions. The adequacy of earnings is a fundamental aspect of job "
"quality, and these deficits in job quality could be keeping workers and "
"their families in poverty.</p>\n"
"<p>The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working "
"poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour "
"force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light "
"on the relationship between employment and household poverty.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<p><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such "
"factors as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of "
"PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price "
"levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be "
"categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living "
"below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the "
"same degree of need.</p>\n"
"<p>Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to "
"households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households "
"pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.</p>\n"
"<p>Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage "
"and other employment-related income secured by those household members in "
"employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available "
"income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. "
"Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her "
"own income, the income of other household members and the number of "
"household members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to "
"study household structure in relation to working poverty. </p>"
