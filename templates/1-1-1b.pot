"Employed persons: All persons of working age who, during a short reference "
"period such as a day or a week, performed work for others in exchange for "
"pay or profit.\n"
"\n"
"Poverty Line: Threshold below which individuals in the reference population "
"are considered poor and above which they are considered non-poor. The "
"threshold is generally defined as the per-capita monetary requirements an "
"individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic bundle of goods and "
"services. For the purposes of this indicator, an absolute international "
"poverty line of US$1.90 per day is used.\n"
"\n"
"Household in poverty: Households are defined as poor if their income or "
"consumption expenditure is below the poverty line taking into account the "
"number of household members and composition (e.g., number of adults and "
"children).\n"
"\n"
"Working poor: Employed persons living in households that are classified as "
"poor, that is, that have income or consumption levels below the poverty "
"line used for measurement."

msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"The concept of working poverty is captured by combining poverty status with "
"employment status, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in "
"employment, live in poverty. The proportion of working poor in total "
"employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household "
"income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the "
"individual level and sheds light on the relationship between household "
"poverty and employment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such factors "
"as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of PPPs "
"rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels "
"across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be "
"categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living "
"below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the "
"same degree of need.\n"
"\n"
"Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to "
"households, and not to individuals. Based on the assumption that households "
"pool their income, the question asked is whether a household’s total income "
"is sufficient to ensure that it isn’t classified as being in poverty. The "
"poverty status of a household is therefore a function of the wage and other "
"employment-related income secured by those household members who work (plus "
"any non-employment-related income such as transfer payments) and the number "
"of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore "
"depends on his or her own income, the income of other household members and "
"the number of household members – for example, children – who need to be "
"supported. It is thus often valuable to study household structure in "
"relation to working poverty. For example, it may be relevant for some "
"countries to assess the differences in working poverty rates between "
"persons living in households whose members are unrelated individuals from "
"those whose members are related."

"# Data sources\n"
"\n"
"## Description\n"
"\n"
"The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can "
"identify both the poverty status of households and give information on the "
"economic activity of the household’s members. Examples include household "
"income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys "
"(LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect "
"information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing "
"the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to "
"be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same "
"observation period.\n"
"\n"
"Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour "
"force survey may however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire "
"design and sampling issues. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the "
"best instrument for collecting household income or consumption expenditure "
"data given that its survey design typically targets the unemployment rate "
"as the headline indicator, although an attached income module can be "
"designed to achieve statistically reliable results, including ensuring an "
"overlap in the observation period between household income (or consumption "
"expenditure) and employment status. Another possibility is to combine data "
"from a household income and expenditure survey and from a separate labour "
"force survey when the respondent households can be matched and consistency "
"in the long observation period between the surveys can be obtained."
