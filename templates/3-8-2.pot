"## Sources of discrepancies\n"
"\n"
"Country level estimates are all based on nationally representative surveys "
"with information on both household total expenditure or income and "
"household expenditure on health (see data sources). In most cases such data "
"come from non-standard household surveys and  ex-post standardization "
"processes can be designed to increase the degree of comparability across "
"countries. For instance, regional teams from the World Bank produce "
"standardized versions of raw datasets following common regional procedures: "
"the ECAPOV harmonized datasets are based  on the Living Standards "
"Measurement Study datasets – LSMS [^8] or household budget surveys (HBS) "
"collected in the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia region; the SHIP "
"collection results from a poverty program on harmonized household surveys "
"in the World Bank’s African region, while the SHES collection was developed "
"by the World Bank for the international comparison program . [^9] The "
"Luxembourg income study (LIS) datasets results from effort to harmonize "
"datasets from many high and middle-income countries. [^10] \n"
"\n"
"In some cases the raw data is accessible to produce country level "
"estimates. In some countries in addition to the raw data a standardized "
"version of it is available and in other countries only the standardized "
"version is. When multiple versions of the same survey are available the "
"best performing in terms of a series of quality assurance tests is retained "
"(see collection process). When a standardized version of a nationally "
"designed survey instruments is chosen there are differences between "
"expenditure variables generated using the raw data, and the expenditure "
"variables generated using the harmonization procedures which might result "
"in different estimated incidence of the population with large household "
"expenditure on health as a share of household total expenditure or income."

"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the “Proportion of the population with large "
"household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure "
"or income”. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two "
"main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on "
"health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when "
"unavailable, income (denominator).\n"
"\n"
"### Numerator\n"
"\n"
"Household expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at "
"the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, "
"curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all "
"medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all "
"health products, *from any type of provider and for all members of the "
"household.* These health expenditures are characterized by a direct "
"payments that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), "
"savings or loans  **but do not include any third-party payer "
"reimbursement**. As such they only grant access to the health services and "
"health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the "
"healthy and the sick beyond the household [^1] and solely based on the "
"willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care "
"payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of "
"health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for "
"Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable "
"source of funding for the health system.\n"
"\n"
"The components of a household’s health care consumption expenditure so "
"defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN "
"Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) "
"which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products "
"(06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) "
"but is being expanded. [^2]\n"
"\n"
"Further information on definitions and classifications (for example by "
"provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be "
"consistent with the [international classification for health "
"accounts](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/en/) and its "
"family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, "
"Eurostat and the World Health Organization.\n"
"\n"
"### Denominator\n"
"\n"
"Expenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary "
"welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, "
"which is a measure of a household’s long-term economic resources that "
"determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of "
"the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the "
"household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the "
"imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured "
"otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually "
"collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure "
"‘consumption’ depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable "
"goods and/or are directly produced by households.\n"
"\n"
"The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to "
"the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during "
"the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less "
"direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is "
"generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from "
"household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in "
"cash and goods, transfers received as services. [^3]\n"
"\n"
"Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater "
"variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to "
"measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on "
"both household consumption and income the former is used (see the “comments "
"and limitations” section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to "
"the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 "
"currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on "
"consumption (see section on data sources).\n"
"\n"
"### Thresholds\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify "
"large household expenditure on health as share of total household "
"consumption or income: **a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher "
"threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25)**. With these two thresholds the indicator "
"measures financial hardship (see section on comments and limitations)."

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"## Collection process\n"
"\n"
"WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where "
"the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is "
"constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by "
"WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices "
"to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken.\n"
"\n"
"The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical "
"Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received "
"indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS "
"(Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have "
"received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and "
"the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for "
"Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics "
"on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin "
"American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys "
"conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, "
"including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity "
"building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work "
"programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty "
"economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on "
"poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance "
"activities.\n"
"\n"
"The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 "
"following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine "
"estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a "
"joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates "
"is based on the following quality checks:\n"
"\n"
"For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio\n"
"\n"
"* Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark "
"source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from "
"the survey.  Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international "
"(PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet  if available, and "
"otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI) , computed as the "
"household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international "
"divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of "
"total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of "
"the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total "
"per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the "
"comparison is with PovcalNet [^13] and greater than 15% when the comparison "
"is made with the WDI [^14] the survey point is identified as an outlier "
"internationally in terms of consumption per capita.\n"
"* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a "
"day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in "
"PovcalNet  at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute "
"difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 "
"percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the "
"incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion.\n"
"* Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a "
"day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in "
"PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute "
"difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 "
"percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty "
"headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.\n"
"\n"
"For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio\n"
"* Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark "
"average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of "
"household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and "
"aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local "
"currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the "
"survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share "
"spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of "
"household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the [Global Health "
"Expenditure Database](http://www.who.int/health-accounts/ghed/en/) (GHED) "
"[^15] and the [World Development Indicators "
"Database](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-"
"indicators) (WDI) [^16] . Information on household final consumption "
"expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).\n"
"\n"
"These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those "
"countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data "
"source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report "
"on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018.\n"
"At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank "
"assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with "
"large household expenditure on health as a share of total household "
"expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then "
"undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board "
"resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing "
"estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given "
"indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to "
"ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the "
"indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft "
"estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are "
"available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to "
"WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates "
"that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country "
"consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these "
"received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received "
"only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the "
"57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available "
"for 32 of them.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the "
"World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack "
"of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the "
"Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has "
"several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the "
"production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet "
"routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being "
"available and the methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are "
"not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but "
"estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality "
"assurance process just described."

"This indicator relies primarily on the same data sources that are used to "
"monitor SDG indicator 1.1.1 with the additional requirement of the "
"availability of information regarding health expenditures. Taking this into "
"account, the World Bank and WHO have identified 1566 potentially suitable "

"excluded because they were either inaccessible, lacked key variables "
"required for the estimation of the proportion of the population with large "
"household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure "
"or income, they did not pass the quality assurance process or were not part "
"of a consistent time series.  As of December 2017 a total of 553 datapoints "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Target 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including "
"financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services "
"and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines "
"and vaccines for all”.  The concern is with all people and communities "
"receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and "
"other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have "
"been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 "
"is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that "
"combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal "
"and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and "
"service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 "
"focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household’s budget to "
"identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken "
"together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service "
"coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. "
"These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.\n"
"\n"
"Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s "
"developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World "
"Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need "
"to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or "
"income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to "
"get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of "
"disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who "
"made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for "
"example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or "
"contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance "
"the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. \n"
"\n"
"This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting "
"access based on health needs not a household’s capacity to pull together "
"all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some "
"direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the "
"conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose "
"between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services "
"such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One "
"way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial "
"hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large "
"household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption "
"or income.  For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor "
"the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the "
"SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult   Wagstaff et al. "
"(2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on “Tracking "
"universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report”."

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same "
"household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on "
"poverty. [^4] These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes "
"such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are "
"conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the "
"population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total "
"household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection "
"burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household "
"non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, "
"indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, "
"data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.  "
"However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.\n"
"\n"
"First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that "
"individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay "
"for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the "
"source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. "
"In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household "
"spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any "
"expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed "
"by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition "
"given for direct health care payments (the numerator). \n"
"For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective "
"reimbursement – for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme – "
"the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally "
"or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall "
"period of the household survey. \n"
"\n"
"Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather "
"information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for "
"health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that "
"health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. \n"
"\n"
"Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health "
"expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on "
"health to either household income or total household expenditure. "
"Expenditure is the recommended measure of household’s resources (see "
"concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while "
"statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, "
"their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income "
"based measures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the "
"population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than "
"expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and World Bank 2017 "
"report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff et al "
"2018) .\n"
"\n"
"Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what "
"constitutes ‘large health expenditure as a share of total household "
"expenditure or income’. People just below such threshold are not taken into "
"account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This "
"is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the "
"health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to "
"identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is "
"devoting any share of its household’s budget to health. \n"
"\n"
"Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health "
"care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to "
"both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not "
"allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight "
"stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly "
"low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being "
"able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are "
"included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. \n"
"\n"
"There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a "
"framework  which includes , __in addition to indicator 3.8.2,__ a "
"definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence "
"spending [^5] [^6] [^7]"

"# Data Sources\n"
"\n"
"## Description\n"
"\n"
"The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the “Proportion of the "
"population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total "
"household expenditure or income” are household surveys with information on "
"both household consumption expenditure on health and total household "
"consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national "
"statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income "
"and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are "
"primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price "
"indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source "
"of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some "
"of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption "
"expenditures – for example, when a country measures poverty using income as "
"the welfare measure . [^11] The most important criterion for selecting a "
"data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both "
"household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption "
"expenditures.\n"
"\n"
"When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG "
"indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG "
"Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2.  For "
"any type of household survey, given the focus on household health "
"expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for "
"cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating "
"with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this "
"happens. [^12]"
