"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) "
"(United Nations, 2011) define an **enterprise** as the smallest legal unit "
"that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The "
"enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating "
"to its production activities and transactions, including financial and "
"balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional "
"sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts.\n"
"\n"
"An **establishment** is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise "
"that is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive "
"activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity "
"accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined "
"ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or "
"control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly "
"one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, "
"factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an "
"establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in "
"industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.\n"
"\n"
"Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that "
"there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their "
"magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If "
"a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as "
"important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local "
"unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as "
"taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in "
"which the principal activity takes place.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of most **small-sized businesses**, the enterprise and the "
"establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and complex "
"with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different "
"locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more "
"establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units "
"can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled.\n"
"\n"
"As introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an **economic activity** "
"is understood as referring to a process, that is to say, to the combination "
"of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, goods "
"and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, "
"industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic activities "
"of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined in "
"terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All "
"Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or "
"International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic "
"Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).\n"
"\n"
"**Total numbers of persons employed** is defined as the total number of "
"persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or "
"part-time, including:\n"
"\n"
"* Working proprietors\n"
"* Active business partners\n"
"* Unpaid family workers\n"
"* Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).\n"
"\n"
"The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined "
"primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit "
"during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is "
"not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may "
"be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of "
"the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, "
"10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum "
"division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where "
"required, should be developed within this framework.\n"
"\n"
"A **loan** is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends "
"funds directly to a debtor and receives a nonnegotiable document as "
"evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, "
"loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, "
"financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on "
"or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of "
"loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable "
"are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets "
"should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded "
"occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, "
"2011).\n"
"\n"
"**Lines of credit** and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn "
"funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset "
"exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines of credit and "
"undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing "
"institutions— generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers "
"to regulated financial institutions only."

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"## Collection process\n"
"\n"
"One of the main sources of data for this indicator currently available is "
"the Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank which covers the formal "
"sector and contains data for small and medium enterprises only (with 5 or "
"more employees).  In some countries, additional surveys, including Informal "
"Surveys of unregistered enterprises and/or Micro Surveys for registered "
"firms with less than five employees, are conducted and available at country "
"level.\n"
"\n"
"The Enterprise Survey is based on a representative sample of enterprises "
"run by the private sector. The surveys cover a broad range of business "
"environment topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, "
"crime, competition, and performance measures. Since 2002, the World Bank "
"has collected these data from face-to-face interviews with top managers and "
"business owners in over 130,000 companies in 135 economies.\n"
"\n"
"The surveys have been conducted since 2002 by different units within the "
"World Bank. Since 2005-06, most data collection efforts have been "
"centralized within the Enterprise Analysis Unit. Data from 2006 onward is "
"comparable across countries. The raw individual country datasets, "
"aggregated datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all "
"relevant survey documentation are publicly available on the Enterprise "
"Surveys web site.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator uses a simple weighted percentage formula, where the weights "
"are the sampling weights. The strata for Enterprise Surveys are firm size, "
"business sector, and geographic region within a country. Enterprise Surveys "
"provide indicators covering manufacturing and services activities. "
"Proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit for "
"manufacturing only can be extracted from the micro data.\n"
"Enterprises are classified as small, medium or large based on the number of "
"employees as follows:\n"
"\n"
"Size of enterprise |Number of employees\n"
"---|---\n"
"Small | 5 to 19\n"
"Medium | 20 to 99\n"
"Large | more than 99\n"
"\n"
"The survey also defines an enterprise with female ownership as an "
"enterprise having at least one female owner, and female-managed is measured "
"by whether the top manager is a woman."

msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium "
"for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, "
"scale of investment and other economic characteristics. “Small-scale "
"industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled "
"labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total "
"industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing "
"countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing "
"surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery "
"is very high. “Small-scale industries” are capable of meeting domestic "
"demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc. \n"
"\n"
"Thus “small-scale industries” play an important role in the economy. "
"However, it has quite limited access to financial services, especially in "
"developing countries. In order to improve the skill of workers and "
"technology for production, small-scale industrial enterprises require "
"financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This "
"indicator shows how widely financial institutions are serving the "
"“small-scale industries”. Together with the indicator SDG 9.3.1, this "
"indicator reflects the main message of the target 9.3 which promotes to "
"increase the access of “small-scale industries” to financial services."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"The main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by "
"country indicating that data are obtained from different target "
"populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another. \n"
"\n"
"The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal "
"and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration "
"procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale "
"industries”. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for "
"compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries "
"compile the data by a size class of “small-scale industries” as with less "
"than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable "
"data on the share of “small-scale industries” in total could be derived."
