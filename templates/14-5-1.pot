"## Definition\n"
"The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows "
"temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine "
"biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global "
"persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in "
"biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of marine natural "
"resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism "
"for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring "
"progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine "
"ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international "
"agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any "
"given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single "
"ecosystem type.\n"
"\n"
"Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area "
"management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are "
"maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are "
"used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction "
"of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected "
"areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; "
"maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; "
"supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for "
"science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other "
"non-material values.\n"
"\n"
"This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from "
"traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by "
"protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a "
"country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 "
"(e.g., Chape et al. \n"
"2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the "
"extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. "
"2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of "
"areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic "
"Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an "
"indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Target "
"(Butchart et al. 2010)."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of "
"Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, "
"recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, "
"to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem "
"services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management "
"objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, "
"restoration, and sustainable use:\n"
"\n"
"* Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\n"
"* Category Ib: Wilderness area\n"
"* Category II: National park\n"
"* Category III: Natural monument or feature\n"
"* Category IV: Habitat/species management area\n"
"* Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\n"
"* Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\n"
"\n"
"The status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the "
"corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common "
"practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially "
"endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the "
"purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising "
"because of some other activity (e.g., military).\n"
"\n"
"Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity "
"are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification "
"of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two "
"variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to "
"date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity "
"Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence "
"of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in "
"total have been identified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife "
"International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for "
"Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding "
"effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as "
"Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened "
"Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been "
"identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, "
"conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the "
"identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along "
"with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other "
"species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016)."

"## Comments and limitations\n"
"Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and "
"comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New "
"data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated "
"into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. "
"Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and "
"new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and "
"resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for "
"the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity "
"Areas.\n"
"\n"
"The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in "
"reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of "
"management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number "
"of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, "
"numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area "
"management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. "
"2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a "
"complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 \n"
"(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little "
"relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & "
"Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to “green listing” have started to "
"be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes "
"of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important "
"as they are tested and applied more broadly.\n"
"\n"
"Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining "
"whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and "
"some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, "
"“other effective area-based conservation measures”, as specified by Aichi "
"Biodiversity Target \n"
"11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some "
"sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily "
"for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are "
"consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are "
"important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, standard approaches to "
"documentation of “other effective area-based conservation measures” are "
"still under debate through the IUCN Task Force on Other Effective Areas "
"Based Conservation Measures which will conclude with recommendations for a "
"definition on OECMs. Once defined it is likely OEMCs will be documented in "
"the World Database on Protected Areas.\n"
"\n"
"Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site "
"identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for "
"example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly "
"threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While "
"Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good "
"surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. "
"2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key "
"Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of "
"biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups "
"remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, "
"Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012).\n"
"\n"
"Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of "
"countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal "
"calculation of the site importance (or “irreplaceability”) using systematic "
"conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols "
"et al. 2014).\n"
"\n"
"Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the "
"taxonomic coverage of marine Key Biodiversity Areas through application of "
"the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine "
"vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in "
"the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of "
"sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary "
"polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other methods for "
"assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage."

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"# Methodology\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap "
"between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on "
"Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2017) and digital polygons for marine Key "
"Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, "
"including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero "
"Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the "
"[Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-"
"conservation/login)). The value of the indicator at a "
"given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area "
"establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is "
"computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently "
"recognised that is covered by protected areas.\n"
"\n"
"Year of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas "
"in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around "
"changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a "
"year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same "
"country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median "
"plotted. In 2017 we slightly changed the methods described by Butchart et "
"al. (2012, 2015) by randomly assigning a year to protected areas with no "
"year of establishment before calculating trends in coverage. This is a "
"computationally more efficient method and is likely to reflect more "
"accurately changes in protected area coverage over time. \n"
"\n"
"Previously the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key "
"Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is "
"now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered "
"by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area "
"coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas "
"that are completely covered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "DISAGGREGATION"
msgid ""
"## Disaggregation\n"
"Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, "
"it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels "
"(e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. "
"Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine "
"environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be "
"reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or "
"freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key "
"Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater "
"systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply "
"additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to "
"different protected area management categories (categories I–VI) to reflect "
"differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across "
"important sites for marine biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 14.5, "
"other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular "
"relevance as indicators towards SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2016) include:\n"
"\n"
"SDG 15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater "
"biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.  \n"
"SDG 15.4.1 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain "
"biodiversity.\n"
"\n"
"Protected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to "
"yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area "
"overlay with eco-regional maps can be used to provide information on "
"protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. "
"Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species "
"(e.g., mammals, birds) can similarly provide indicators of trends in "
"coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can "
"be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts "
"of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). "
"Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform "
"sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas "
"onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion "
"of overall city space."

msgctxt "IMPUTATION"
msgid ""
"## Treatment of missing values\n"
"* At country level:  \n"
"    Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of "
"the world’s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level "
"data is necessary. \n"
"* At regional and global levels:  \n"
"    Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for "
"biodiversity are calculated as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity "
"Area that is covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all "
"countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no "
"missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REG_AGG"
msgid ""
"## Regional aggregates\n"
"UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and "
"regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International "
"and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of "
"importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional "
"figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated "
"from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through "
"Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected "
"Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission "
"on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a "
"Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas "
"such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location "
"(point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated "
"using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas "
"whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital "
"boundaries are excluded from the indicator.\n"
"\n"
"Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international "
"significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data "
"for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a "
"standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to "
"threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. "
"Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as "
"possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological "
"importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the "
"trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, "
"alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be "
"managed in some way.\n"
"\n"
"Alliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment "
"(supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as "
"listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability "
"(holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of "
"the target species, for at least one life history segment); and "
"discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of "
"habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in "
"common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence "
"Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species "
"extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected "
"or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of "
"populations of target species).\n"
"\n"
"The Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction "
"site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for "
"biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent "
"the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically "
"worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as "
"formal protected areas."

msgctxt "ADJUSTMENT"
msgid ""
"## Sources of discrepancies\n"
"National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently "
"aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World "
"Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences "
"between national indicators and the global one. One minor source of "
"difference is that the World Database on Protected Areas incorporates "
"internationally-designated protected areas (e.g., World Heritage sites, "
"Ramsar sites, etc), a few of which are not considered by their sovereign "
"nations to be protected areas. \n"
"\n"
"Note that because countries do not submit comprehensive data on degazetted "
"protected areas to the WDPA, earlier values of the indictor may marginally "
"underestimate coverage."

"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data "
"at the national level\n"
"The WDPA has its origins in a 1959 UN mandate when the United Nations "
"Economic and Social Council called for a list of national parks and "
"equivalent reserves Resolution 713 (XXVIII). More details are available "
"here: <https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas>. "
"The UN List of Protected Areas has been published in 1961/62, 1966/71, 1972 "
"(addendum to the 1966/71 edition), 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1985, "
"1990, 1993, 1997, 2003 and 2014 which have resulted in a global network of "
"national data providers for the WDPA. For example, in 2014 all Convention "
"on Biological Diversity (CBD) National Focal points and all National Focal "
"points for the CBD Protected Areas Programme of Work (PoWPA) to request "
"data for the 2014 Un List of Protected Areas "
"(<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/united-nations-list-of-protected-areas/>"
"united-nations-list-of-protected-areas-2014). Protected areas data is "
"therefore compiled directly from government agencies, regional hubs and "
"other authoritative sources in the absence of a government source. All "
"records have a unique metadata identifier (MetadataID) which links the "
"spatial database to the Source table where all sources are described. The "
"data is collated and standardised following the WDPA Data Standards and "
"validated with the source. The process of collation, validation and "
"publication of data as well as protocols and the WDPA data standards are "
"regularly updated in the WDPA User Manual "
"(<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>) made available through "
"www.protectedplanet.net where all spatial data and the Source table are "
"also published every month and can be downloaded.   The process for "
"compilation of data on sites contributing significantly to the global "
"persistence of biodiversity (Key Biodiversity Areas) is documented online "
"(<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>). Specifically, "
"(<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/what-are-kbas>), the Key Biodiversity "
"Area identification process is a highly inclusive, consultative and "
"bottom-up exercise. Although anyone with appropriate scientific data may "
"propose a site to qualify as a Key Biodiversity Area, wide consultation "
"with stakeholders at the national level (both non-governmental and "
"governmental organizations) is required during the proposal process. Key "
"Biodiversity Area identification builds off the existing network of Key "
"Biodiversity Areas, including those identified as Important Bird & "
"Biodiversity Areas through the BirdLife Partnership of 120 national "
"organisations "
"(<http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners>), for the "
"Alliance for Zero Extinction by 93 national and international organisations "
"(<http://www.zeroextinction.org/partners.html>), and as other Key "
"Biodiversity Areas by civil society organisations supported by the Critical "
"Ecosystem Partnership Fund in developing ecosystem profiles, named in each "
"of the profiles listed here "
"(<http://www.cepf.net/resources/publications/Pages/ecosystem_profiles.aspx>), "
"with new data strengthening and expanding expand the network of these "

"the Documentation Standards for Key Biodiversity Areas. Sites confirmed by "
"the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat to qualify as Key Biodiversity Areas "
"then appear on the Key Biodiversity Areas website "
"(<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>).\n"
"\n"
"The WDPA User Manual (<https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/wdpa-manual>)  "
"published in English, Spanish, and French provides guidance to countries on "
"how to submit protected areas data to the WDPA, what are the benefits of "

"Biodiversity Areas website (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/home>). "
"Specifically (<http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/get-involved>), the main "
"steps of the Key Biodiversity Area identification process are the "
"following: \n"
"\n"
"1. submission of Expressions of Intent to identify a Key Biodiversity Area "
"to Regional Focal Points;  \n"
"2. Proposal Development process, in which proposers compile relevant data "

"4. a Site Nomination phase comprising the submission of all the relevant "
"documentation for verification by the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat "
"(see section 3.3 below).  \n"
"Once a Key Biodiversity Area is identified, monitoring of its qualifying "

"period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with "
"national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and "
"maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data "
"become available. The World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas is also "
"updated on an ongoing basis, as new national data are submitted."

"## Description\n"
"Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on "
"Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, "
"according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of "
"Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through "
"[Protected Planet](http://www.protectedplanet.net/), which is jointly "
"managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas "
"(UNEP-WCMC 2016). Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the "
"[World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas]"
"(http://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/), managed by BirdLife International "
"(2017). Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are "
"available online at [BirdLife International (2016)]"
"(http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/site/search) and data on Alliance for "
"Zero Extinction sites are available online at [AZE (2010)]"
"(http://www.zeroextinction.org/). Both datasets, along with the World "
"Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the [Integrated "
"Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning]"
"(https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login)."
