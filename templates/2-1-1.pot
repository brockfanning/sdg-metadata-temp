"## Definition\n"
"\n"
"The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de "
"sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentación; Italian: "
"prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the "
"population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the "
"dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and "
"healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"## Rationale\n"
"\n"
"The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target "
"and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. "
"It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a "
"population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes "
"in the overall availability of food, in the households’ ability to access "
"it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well "
"as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. \n"
"\n"
"The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimates "
"for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition "
"of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims "
"at reducing hunger."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "CLASS_SYSTEM"
msgid ""
"## Concepts\n"
"\n"
"Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, "
"on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the "
"energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his "
"or her own dietary energy requirements. \n"
"\n"
"Though strictly related, “undernourishment” as defined here is different "
"from the physical conditions of “malnutrition” and “undernutrition” as it "
"refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the "
"outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the "
"difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentación, or "
"alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutrición or nutrizione, in the name "
"of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would "
"render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been “prevalence of "
"under-feeding” but by now the term “undernourishment” has long been "
"associated with the indicator. \n"
"\n"
"While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to "
"conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be "
"referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of "
"undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a "
"group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the "
"identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, "
"undernourished."

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"## Comments and limitations\n"
"\n"
"Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the "
"PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment "
"should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by "
"comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. "
"According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply "
"computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample "
"of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a "
"comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. "
"Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to "
"the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption "
"is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively "
"small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically "
"unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that "
"observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is "
"still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This "
"means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the "
"individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer "
"on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by "
"the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic "
"over time, of the same individual. \n"
"\n"
"The model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates "
"information that is available with sufficient regularity from different "
"sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, "
"thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor "
"progress towards reducing global hunger. \n"
"\n"
"Further specific consideration \n"
"\n"
"1. Feasibility \n"
"\n"
"    Estimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries in "
"the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food "
"consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based "
"estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary "
"energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect "
"estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the "
"country’s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price "
"of food, or other indicators of development such as country’s Under 5 "
"Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement "
"(MDER) based on the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects "
"data. \n"
"\n"
"2. Reliability \n"
"\n"
"    Reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the "
"estimation of the model’s parameters. \n"
"\n"
"    DEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. "
"Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national "
"DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted. \n"
"\n"
"    DEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement "
"errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete "
"recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a "
"negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated "
"daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food "
"consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See "
"De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, "
"<https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf> "
"). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget Survey in Brazil "
"revealed how food provided for free through the school meals program and "
"consumed by children while at school, had not been accounted among the "
"sources of household food consumption, accounting for a downward bias of "
"the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of 674 kcal. (See "
"Borlizzi, Cafiero & Del Grossi, forthcoming.) \n"
"\n"
"    DEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, "
"though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As "
"average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in "
"reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of "
"national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the "
"difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity "
"utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, "
"the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than "
"each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, "
"considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in "
"national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be "
"unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is "
"prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the "
"estimated DEC in each given year. \n"
"\n"
"    To limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented "
"estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the "
"presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations "
"in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average "
"over three consecutive years. \n"
"\n"
"    Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As "
"described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless "
"obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to "
"be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that "
"would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring "
"individual habitual dietary energy intake. \n"
"\n"
"3. Comparability \n"
"\n"
"    If the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and "
"space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity "
"found in the different quality of the background data. \n"
"\n"
"4. Limitations \n"
"\n"
"    Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of "
"uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the "
"model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it "
"is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU "
"estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 2.5% in most cases. "
"For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they "
"are larger than 2.5%. This also suggests that 2.5% is the lowest feasible "
"target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is "
"unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge "
"of hunger. \n"
"\n"
"    If no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that is "
"representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed at "
"national level."

"# Methodology \n"
"\n"
"## Computation method\n"
"\n"
"The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the "
"population is represented by an “average” individual for which a "
"probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels "
"is modelled through a parametric probability density function (pdf). \n"
"\n"
"Once the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the cumulative "
"probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are below the "
"lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements for that "
"representative, or average individual (MDER), as in the formula below: \n"
"\n"
"PoU= ∫_(x<MDER) f(x | DEC; CV; Skew) dx \n"
"\n"
"where DEC, CV and Skew are the mean, coefficient of variation and skewness "
"that characterize the distribution of habitual dietary energy consumption "
"levels in the population. \n"
"\n"
"Until 2012, the probability distribution f(x) was modelled as a Log-normal "
"pdf, informed by only two parameters: mean and coefficient of variation. In "
"its most recent formulation, it is modelled as a three-parameter pdf, able "
"to represent different degrees of skewness, ranging from that of a "
"symmetric Normal distribution to that of the positively skewed Log-normal "
"distribution. The flexibility in capturing different degrees of skewness is "
"needed to take into account the fact that human energy consumption levels "
"are naturally bounded by physiological limits. It is thus conceivable that, "
"as mean consumption levels increases, the skewness of the distribution "
"decreases, gradually moving from (positively skewed) Log-normal "
"distributions, typical of populations where average food consumption is "
"relatively low, towards (symmetric) Normal distributions. The skew-normal "
"and skew-lognormal families of distribution allow for the characterization "
"of all possible intermediate degrees of positive skewness. (See "
"<http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf> for a detailed description) \n"
"\n"
"A custom R function is available from the Statistics Division at FAO to "
"compute the PoU, given the four parameters DEC, CV, Skew and MDER. \n"
"\n"
"Different data sources can be used to estimate the different parameters of "
"the model. \n"
"\n"
"DEC  \n"
"The mean of the distribution of dietary energy consumption levels for the "
"average individual in a population (DEC) corresponds, by definition, to the "
"average, daily per capita food consumption level in the population. \n"
"\n"
"DEC can be estimated from data on food consumption obtained through surveys "
"that are representative of the population of interest. Depending on the "
"survey design, they can be used to estimate DEC at national and at sub "
"national levels, either by geographic areas or by socio-economic population "
"groups. Unfortunately, though the situation is rapidly improving, "
"representative surveys that collect food consumption data are still not "
"available for every country and every year. \n"
"\n"
"For the national population only, DEC can be estimated also from accounts "
"of the total supply and utilization of all food commodities in a country, "
"where the contribution of each commodity to the availability of food for "
"human consumption is expressed in their dietary energy content, and their "
"total is divided by the size of the population. The major source of data on "
"national food balances are the Food Balance Sheets (FBS) maintained by FAO "
"for most countries in the world (see "
"<http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/>), informed by official data "
"reported by member countries, and disseminated through FAOSTAT "
"(<http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E>) \n"
"\n"
"CV  \n"
"Surveys that contain information on food consumption at individual or "
"household level are the only available source to directly estimate the CV "
"of habitual food consumption for the representative individual in the "
"population. Unfortunately, survey data on food consumption are fraught by "
"many problems that complicate the reliable estimation of CV. \n"
"\n"
"In principle, repeated observations of daily consumption for each "
"individual in a sample would be needed to estimate levels of habitual "
"consumption and to control for measurement errors. Moreover, data should be "
"collected in different periods of the year on the same individuals or "
"households to account for possible seasonal variation in levels of dietary "
"energy consumption. Due to their cost, nationally representative individual "
"dietary intake surveys with such characteristics are very rare, and "
"virtually inexistent for most developing countries. As a consequence, the "
"most common sources of data to estimate CV are multipurpose household "
"surveys, such as Living Standard Measurement Surveys, Household Incomes and "
"Expenditure Surveys (or Household Budgets Survey), that collect also "
"information on food consumption. When using data collected at household "
"level however, careful attention should be taken in distinguishing levels "
"of food purchases or acquisitions from levels of actual utilization "
"(consumption and wastage) during the identified reference period and in "
"properly recording the number of individuals who participate in "
"consumption; moreover, household level data will mask the variability due "
"to intra-household allocation of food. \n"
"\n"
"For all these reasons, the coefficient of variation calculated on the "
"series of average per capita daily dietary energy consumption levels "
"recorded for each household included in a survey is never a reliable "
"estimate of CV, which should reflect variability in the levels of habitual "
"(and not occasional) daily dietary energy consumption level, at the "
"individual (and not household) level. Empirical estimates of CV from "
"household survey data are upward biased due to the spurious variability "
"induced by measurement error, differences between occasional and habitual "
"consumption, differences between acquisition and actual consumption and "
"seasonality; moreover, they do not reflect the variability in dietary "
"energy consumption in the population associated with individual "
"characteristics of the household members (such as sex, age, body mass and "
"physical activity levels). \n"
"\n"
"When using data collected through household surveys, CV is thus best "
"estimated indirectly, controlling for spurious variability, and adjusted to "
"reflect inter-individuals (in addition to inter-households) variability. "
"The simplest way to proceed is to classify households into homogeneous "
"groups and to calculate the coefficient of variation of the average per "
"capita dietary energy consumption across household groups. This yields an "
"estimate of the inter-households component of CV, labelled CV_H. An "
"estimate of the inter-individuals component of the CV, labelled CV_I, is "
"obtained, for each population, from its structure by sex, age and body "
"masses, and the two components are combined to obtain the needed estimate "
"as: \n"
"\n"
"CV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )]. \n"
"\n"
"For countries and years when no data from household survey are available, "
"an indirect estimate of the CV, CV_IND, is obtained via a regression that "
"projects the values of per capita GDP, Gini coefficient of income, and an "
"index of the relative price of food (FPI) on the CV, while controlling for "
"a regional shifter (REG). \n"
"\n"
"CV^_IND=ß_0+ß_1 GDP+ ß_2 GINI+ ß_3 FPI+ß_4 REG. \n"
"\n"
"Coefficients of the regression are estimated from the set of data and years "
"for which data on CV, GDP, GINI and FPI are available. \n"
"\n"
"Skew  \n"
"As skewness is not strongly affected by the presence of spurious "
"variability, Skew is estimated directly from household level data on the "
"average daily dietary consumption, with the only exception of eliminating "
"rare extremely high or extremely low values. If the empirically estimated "
"skewness exceeds the value that would correspond to the skewness of "
"Log-normal distribution with given mean and coefficient of variation, the "
"parameter is neglected and a two parameter lognormal distribution is used "
"for f(x). (See <http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf> for additional details). \n"
"\n"
"MDER  \n"
"Human energy requirements are computed by multiplying normative "
"requirements for basic metabolic rate (BMR, expressed per kg of body mass) "
"by the ideal weight of a healthy person of given height, and then "
"multiplied by a coefficient of physical activity level (PAL). Ranges of "
"normal energy requirements are thus computed for each sex and age group of "
"the population, observing that there exist a whole range of Body Mass Index "
"(BMI) values – from 18.5 to 25 – that are compatible with health. This "
"implies that any given attained height might correspond to a whole range of "
"healthy body weights, and therefore to a range of values for energy "
"requirement for BMR. \n"
"\n"
"Given information on the median height and the consideration that the group "
"might contain individuals engaged in different levels of physical activity, "
"the minimum, average and maximum dietary energy requirement can be computed "
"for every sex and age class by taking into consideration special allowances "
"for growth in individuals aged 0-21 and for pregnancy and lactation. \n"
"(See ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf for further "
"details). \n"
"\n"
"The MDER for a given population group, including for the national "
"population, is obtained as the weighted average of the minimums of the "
"energy requirements ranges of each sex and age class, using the population "
"size in each class as weights. \n"
"\n"
"In computing the prevalence of dietary energy inadequacy in a population "
"there has often been confusion between the concept of MDER and that of the "
"Recommended Dietary Energy Intake, and regarding the appropriate threshold "
"to be used to compute the probability of inadequacy. The reason why the "
"probability of dietary energy inadequacy should be computed with reference "
"to the MDER, and not the ADER (which, instead, can be used as an estimate "
"of the average recommended dietary intake level for the whole population) "
"is simply to recognize the fact that in any population there exists a "
"certain range of normal variability in requirements; using the ADER as a "
"threshold would greatly overestimate undernourishment as it would count "
"also the proportion of the healthy population that consumes less than "
"average, simply because of having less than average requirements. When "
"needed, the ADER, or the average Recommended Dietary Energy Intake level in "
"a population must be used instead to compute the dietary energy gap."

msgctxt "DISAGGREGATION"
msgid ""
"## Disaggregation\n"
"\n"
"Due to reliance on national Food Balance Sheets data to estimate mean "
"caloric consumption levels in the population, the global monitoring of MDG "
"Target 1C and of the WFS target has been based on estimates of the PoU at "
"national level only. \n"
"\n"
"In principle, the indicator can be computed for any specific population "
"group, provided sufficient accurate information exists to characterize the "
"model’s parameters for that specific group, that is, if data on the group’s "
"food consumption levels, age/gender structure and – possibly – physical "
"activity levels, exist. \n"
"\n"
"The scope for disaggregation thus crucially depends on the availability of "
"surveys designed to be representative at the level of sub national "
"population groups. Given prevailing practice in the design of national "
"household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for "
"disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) "
"and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most "
"of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of "
"income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of "

"global monitoring. \n"
"\n"
"The most common approach used in preparing national reports has been to "

"daily Recommended Dietary Intake, usually set at 2,100.00 kcal, based on "

msgctxt "DOC_METHOD"
msgid ""
"## Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the "
"data at the national level\n"
"\n"
"The main three sources of data at national level are: \n"
"\n"
"1. Official reports on the production, trade and utilization of the major "
"food crop and livestock productions. \n"
"2. Household survey data on food consumption \n"
"3. Demographic characteristics of the national population \n"
"{:type='a'}\n"
"\n"
"Data sources for agricultural production are usually national surveys that "
"are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock and/or the National "
"Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of "
"direct measurements, use information on areas/animal numbers and crop "
"yields/carcass weights to calculate crop or livestock product quantities. "
"Agricultural censuses, which FAO recommends conducting every ten years, may "
"complement these surveys by providing more updated measured data on crops "
"and livestock, and thus enable more precise projections/revisions. \n"
"\n"
"The data source for agricultural and food trade is almost exclusively the "
"national customs office (with few exceptions where data may be obtained "
"from the Central Bank). Countries often prepare these trade reports "
"following international standard formats (commodity/country "
"classifications, units of measurement, trading partner detail). While such "
"trade data may be considered quite reliable, being the result of direct "
"measurement/reporting by/to the customs office, issues of unreported border "
"trade (and animal movement), misclassification of commodities, "
"confidentiality, time-lag, to name a few, may necessitate some data "
"analysis and validation (often by referring to ‘ mirror’ trade statistics "
"to cross-check quantities and values). \n"
"\n"
"Data on the utilization of primary and processed crops and livestock may be "
"obtained through specialized surveys (supplemented by research) through the "
"national agri-food industry system. Utilizations of interest here are those "
"quantities destined for, among others, animal feed, for industrial uses "
"(e.g. biofuel production), for national/enterprise/farm stocks, for seed "
"(sowing for the successive agricultural cycle) – to enable as accurate an "
"assessment as possible of the quantities destined/available for potential "
"human consumption. \n"
"\n"
"These datasets (production, trade and utilizations), once cross-checked and "
"validated, form the basis for the compilation of the Food Balance Sheets "
"(FBS). The FBS are an accounting framework whereby supply (production + "
"imports + stock withdrawals) should equal utilization (export + food "
"processing + feed + seed + industrial use, etc.). It should be noted that, "
"within the FBS framework, post-harvest/slaughter losses (up to the retail "
"level) are considered as utilization, and thus a component in the balancing "
"of the FBS. The FBS framework provides a snapshot of the agricultural "
"supply situation at the national level, and allows for a cross-referenced "
"structure whereby data, official or estimated/imputed, may be further "
"analyzed and validated (e.g. animal numbers may result as being "
"under-reported/estimated). The main result of the compilation of the FBS is "
"the calculation of the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) in kilocalories per "
"person (based on population figures) in a given year (quantities resulting "
"as available for human consumption are converted into their caloric "
"equivalents by using appropriate nutritive conversion factors by "
"commodity). The DES, in the absence of direct consumption data from "
"household surveys, is one of the key components in the calculation of the "
"Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU). FAO is presently embarking on a more "
"focused program of providing FBS capacity to countries, including an "
"updated compilation tool. \n"
"\n"
"FAO obtains crop/livestock primary/processed production data, and principal "
"utilization thereof, through country-tailored questionnaires that are "
"dispatched to all countries annually. Official country trade statistics are "
"obtained annually through bulk downloads of the United Nations trade "
"database (countries are expected to report to UNSD annually). In some "
"cases, when available, national FBS data are also used. These datasets are "
"then validated and form inputs in the country FBS which FAO compiles. It "
"should be noted that when data are not officially reported/available (as is "
"frequently the case with commodity utilization data), and hence it is "
"necessary to resort to imputations to fill the data gaps. \n"

"# Data Sources \n"
"\n"
"## Description\n"
"\n"
"The ideal source of data to estimate the PoU would be a carefully designed "
"and skillfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in which actual "
"daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for each surveyed "
"individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is representative of "
"the target population. Due to their cost, however, such surveys are rare.\n"
"\n"
"In principle, a well-designed household survey that collects information on "
"food acquisitions might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate of the "
"Prevalence of Undernourishment in a population, at a reasonable cost and "
"with the necessary periodicity to inform the SDG monitoring process, "
"provided that: \n"
"\n"
"1. All sources of food consumption for all members of the households are "
"properly accounted for, including, in particular, food that is consumed "
"away from home; \n"
"\n"
"2. Sufficient information is available to convert the data on food "
"consumption or on food expenditures into their contribution to dietary "
"energy intake; \n"
"\n"
"3. The proper methods to compute the PoU are used, to control for excess "
"variability in the estimated levels of habitual food consumption across "
"households, allowing for the presence on normal variability in the "
"distribution of food consumption across individuals, induced by the "
"differences in energy requirements of the members of the population. \n"
"{:type='a'}"
"\n"
"Examples of surveys that could be considered for this purpose include "
"surveys conducted to compute economic statistics and conduct poverty "
"assessments, such as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Household "
"Budget Surveys and Living Standard Measurement Surveys. \n"
"\n"
"In practice, however, it is often impossible, and not advisable, to rely "
"only on data collected through a household survey, as the information "
"needed to estimate the four parameters of the PoU model is either missing "
"or imprecise. \n"
"\n"
"Household Survey food consumption data often must be integrated by \n"
"a) Data on the demographic structure of the population of interest by sex "
"and age; \n"
"b) Data or information on the median height of individuals in each sex and "
"age class; \n"
"c) Data on the distribution of physical activity levels in the population; \n"
"d) Alternative data on the total amounts of food available for human "
"consumption, to correct for biases in the estimate of the national average "
"daily dietary energy consumption in the population. \n"
"\n"
"Data for a), b) and c) could be available through the same multipurpose "
"survey that provides food consumption data, but are more likely available "
"from other sources, such as National Demographic and Health Surveys (for a) "
"and b) ) and Time Use Surveys (for c) ). \n"
"\n"
"Correcting for bias in the estimated average daily dietary energy "
"consumption might need to be based on alternative sources on food "
"consumption, such as aggregate food supply and utilization accounts and "
"food balance sheets. \n"
"\n"
"To inform its estimate of PoU at national, regional and global level, in "
"addition to all household surveys for which it is possible to obtain micro "
"data on food consumption, FAO relies on: \n"
"a) UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects "
"(<https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/>), which provide "
"updated estimates of the structures of the national population by sex and "
"age every two years for most countries in the world; \n"
"b) FAO Food Balance Sheets (<http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E>), which "
"provides updated estimates of the national availability of food every year "
"for most countries in the world.\n"
"\n"
"Micro data from household surveys that collect food consumption data are "
"sourced by FAO directly through the National Statistical Agencies’ "
"websites, or through specific bilateral agreements."

"## Collection process\n"
"\n"
"Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization "
"used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by "
"Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a data "
"collection questionnaire every year to an identified focal point. \n"
"\n"
"Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National "
"Statistical Agencies. When available, data is sourced by FAO directly "
"through the NSA website. In several cases, when microdata is not available "
"in the public domain, bilateral agreements have been signed, usually in the "
"contexts of technical assistance and capacity development programs. \n"
"\n"
"Data on the population size and structure for all monitored countries is "
"obtained from the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects."
